Each team member should add a text file on the master branch to the top level directory labeled readme.pn.txt 
where the pn would be p1, p2, p3, p4 or p5 based upon which person you are for the lab. 
The contents of the file can really be anything, but should include your name and email. 
Each team member should delete the text file useless.pn.txt where pn is p1,p2, p3, p4 or p5 based on your team member number. 
Do NOT delete the wrong files!!Use good descriptive Log comments for your changes/commitsRoll back changes by viewing (checkout) your original branch from an earlier step.
Verify that none of the changes you have made are in the original branch project version you checked out
